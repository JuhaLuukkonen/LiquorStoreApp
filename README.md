# LiquorStoreApp

Simple Java Maven JSP application. Requires [Apache Tomcat 7](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-70.cgi). [Installation information] for that (https://mkyong.com/maven/how-to-deploy-maven-based-war-file-to-tomcat/) as well.

Download LiquirStoreApp folder locally and execute in terminal:         

mvn tomcat7:run

After successful deployment go into the browser and type http://localhost:8080/LiquorStoreApp

Except previous won't work and IDE gives:

http://localhost:63342/LiquorStoreApp/src/main/webapp/index.html?

Interesting!
